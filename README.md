  <summary>:zap: Our Motivation :zap:</summary>
  
<!--START_SECTION:activity-->
Waste management is a very serious issue across the world. In simple terms, only specific materials can be recycled, and when other objects are mixed in, the entire batch has to be thrown into the garbage. Whenever citizens don‚Äôt recycle properly or dispose of waste improperly, waste management is a harder process. Instead of sorting through the waste, it is simply dumped into landfills or oceans or is incinerated. If everyday citizens were to recycle items correctly, it would make a huge positive impact on the world. Due to ineffective waste management methods, carbon emissions increase. When items that are supposed to be recycled are also thrown into waste, the level of toxins, such as dioxins, released increases by tons. This increases air pollution, contributes to acid rain, and harms the environment.

Resources

When materials are recycled, much fewer resources are required to recreate the same product. This increases efficiency, decreases the release of toxins, decreases the need to acquire resources from the environment, and provides a ‚Äúgreener‚Äù way to create products. However, due to ineffective waste management, a lot of recyclable items are incinerated or disposed of as waste. This increases the carbon footprint of each individual by tons.

<details>
  <summary>:zap: We Strive For The Better World :zap:</summary> 
  
<!--START_SECTION:activity-->
This product sorts through waste items to determine whether they are recyclable, compostable, or simply garbage. It then alerts the user to throw it in a specific bin. This will increase awareness in citizens, reduce carbon emissions by millions of tons if applied properly, and reduce environmental harm. This product is necessary to improve waste management because no matter how many guides or brochures are given, people get caught up and forget to take time to dispose of items correctly. This minimizes the efforts required by the user and maximizes effective waste management. In short, this product is the necessary bridge between pure laziness and a clean world

### üë®‚Äçüíª  User Xperience

<details>
  <summary>:zap: How We Change Human Behavior :zap:</summary> 
  
<!--START_SECTION:activity-->
How is it different from other Products?

We make recycling a sport, not a responsibility. Besides our amazing AI and reward system, we also develop new hassle-free features.

Create Event

You do the magic, we do the detail. Anyone, include organizations, schools or individuals can host public or private, fundraising, or non-profit events. We also allow users to customize their event details/invitations with eye-catching templates. The host can easily check-in, accredit, and give endorsements for attendees.

Realtime Mission

We aware that wherever has humans, there is trash, and the fact there are more smartphones connected to the internet than computers. That is why we develop our mobile app, where users can upload images and make missions. For example, someone illegally threw a trash bag or furniture on the street, users can capture, attach the image, and pin the location then upload the mission. Our AI will sort it, decide the points based on the image. For fairness and to prevent cheating, we only show the points and location. The user who accepts the mission will be expected to show some proofs to get points.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm install` and `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
